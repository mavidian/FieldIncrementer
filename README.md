# FieldIncrementer

Field Incrementer is a very simple browser extension to demonstrate how the web site
contents can be accessed and modified. It allows an input element of a web site to be
incremented in case its current contents is numeric (or empty, which is assumed to be 0).

This extension is inspired on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olz4wo-ILwI and https://github.com/eviltester/counterstringjs

Sample page to test the extension's behavior: https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html
